        <h3>Nuclei Segmentation using UNet</h3>
        <p>Cell nuclei segmentation is a fundamental task in microscopy image analysis, based on which multiple biological related analysis can be performed. Although deep learning (DL) based techniques have achieved state-of-the-art performances in image segmentation tasks, these methods are usually complex and require support of powerful computing resources. In addition, it is impractical to allocate advanced computing resources to each dark- or bright-field microscopy, which is widely employed in vast clinical institutions, considering the cost of medical exams. Thus, it is essential to develop accurate DL based segmentation algorithms working with resources-constraint computing.</p>

        <h3>Human Facial Expressions Detection using CNN</h3>
        <p>The primary idea of our project is to process the input images of human facial emotion to train the model on datasets .In this project we can use a popular deep learning method (convolutional neural networks) to identify the key human emotions like anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutrality.</p>

       <h3>Virtual Assistant Using OpenAI</h3>
        <p>It is a Virtual Assistant like Amazon Alexa or Siri, I use OpenAI API to build this Virtual Assistant. It is written in Python by using openai, pyttsx3, speech_recognition, webbrowser, os modules.</p>

        <h3>Number Tracking Game Using Backtracking Algorithms</h3>
        <p>In this game (CLI Mode Game & Written in C++) two players are there one is the machine and another one is you(the user), user can select the destination number(goal to reach) first then select the maximum number of steps at a time taken by the user or machine to get to the destination number. The winner of this game will be on the basis of, who will reach the destination number first. The game was designed in such a way, if the machine can select its choice first rather than you(the user) then the machine will be the winner, you never beat the machine.</p>
